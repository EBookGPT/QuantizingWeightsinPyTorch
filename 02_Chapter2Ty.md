# Chapter 2: Types of Quantization and Quantization Techniques

Welcome back, dear readers. If you're just joining us, we recently had a special guest, Yann LeCun, who introduced us to the fascinating world of weight quantization in PyTorch. In the previous chapter, we learned about the basics of weight quantization and why it is important in machine learning. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the types of quantization and various quantization techniques.

# Types of Quantization

Quantization can be broadly classified into two types:

- **Linear Quantization**: It involves mapping floating-point numbers to a fixed set of integers in a linear fashion. Linear quantization is the most common technique used in deep learning and is relatively simple to implement.

- **Non-Linear Quantization**: It involves mapping floating-point numbers to a fixed set of integers using a non-linear function. Non-linear quantization can provide better accuracy for specific applications, but it is more complex to implement than linear quantization.

# Quantization Techniques

Now that we have an overview of the types of quantization, let's discuss some of the popular quantization techniques:

- **Uniform Quantization**: It involves dividing the range of floating-point numbers into a fixed number of equally spaced intervals and mapping each interval to a single integer. Uniform quantization is the simplest form of quantization but may not always result in optimal compression.

- **Logarithmic Quantization**: It involves dividing the range of floating-point numbers into a fixed number of logarithmically spaced intervals and mapping each interval to a single integer. Logarithmic quantization can be useful for highly skewed distributions.

- **Clipping Quantization**: It involves clipping the weight values to a fixed range before performing quantization. Clipping quantization can help in preventing outliers from undermining the quantization process.

- **K-Means Quantization**: It involves clustering the weight values using K-Means clustering and mapping each cluster to a single integer. K-Means quantization can result in better compression than uniform quantization.

In the next section, we will see how to implement these quantization techniques to quantize weights in PyTorch. Stay tuned!
# Chapter 2: Types of Quantization and Quantization Techniques

Welcome back to our journey through the world of weight quantization in PyTorch, dear readers. As you may recall, in the previous chapter, we met the master of darkness himself, the infamous Count Dracula, who taught us the basics of weight quantization. In this chapter, we will explore further into the types of quantization and various quantization techniques. And, to our surprise, our special guest Yann LeCun makes another appearance!

## The Mysterious Visit from Yann LeCun

As we were researching and learning about quantization techniques, we received a mysterious message from Yann LeCun, asking to meet us in Transylvania. Although we were apprehensive, we were also excited at the prospect of meeting one of the pioneers in the field of deep learning.

Upon arriving at the castle, we were greeted by Count Dracula himself, who informed us that Yann had been waiting in the grand hall. As we made our way inside, we were greeted by the sight of Yann LeCun, sitting at a table with a pile of books and an old pen in hand.

As we approached him, Yann looked up and greeted us with a warm smile. "I hear that you are exploring quantization techniques," he said. "That's a fascinating topic. Do you know about the different types of quantization?"

## Types of Quantization

Yann went on to explain about the two types of quantization: Linear and Non-Linear quantization.

"Linear quantization involves mapping floating-point numbers to a fixed set of integers in a linear fashion," he said. "It is the most common technique used in deep learning and is relatively simple to implement."

"Non-linear quantization, on the other hand, involves mapping floating-point numbers to a fixed set of integers using a non-linear function," he said. "It can provide better accuracy for specific applications, but it is more complex to implement than linear quantization."

## Quantization Techniques

Next, Yann introduced us to some of the popular quantization techniques.

"Uniform quantization involves dividing the range of floating-point numbers into a fixed number of equally spaced intervals and mapping each interval to a single integer," he said. "It is the simplest form of quantization but may not always result in optimal compression."

"Logarithmic quantization involves dividing the range of floating-point numbers into a fixed number of logarithmically spaced intervals and mapping each interval to a single integer," he said. "It can be useful for highly skewed distributions."

"Clipping quantization involves clipping the weight values to a fixed range before performing quantization," he said. "It can help in preventing outliers from undermining the quantization process."

"K-Means quantization involves clustering the weight values using K-Means clustering and mapping each cluster to a single integer," he said. "It can result in better compression than uniform quantization."

## The Resolution

After the fascinating discussion with Yann LeCun, we returned to our journey through weight quantization in PyTorch.

We learned about the two types of quantization: Linear and Non-Linear quantization. We also explored some of the popular quantization techniques, such as Uniform, Logarithmic, Clipping, and K-Means quantization.

As we continued our research, we found that implementing these quantization techniques in PyTorch was relatively simple. With the help of PyTorch's quantization tools, we could easily apply these techniques to our deep learning models and reap the benefits of optimized memory usage and faster inference.

Stay tuned for our next chapter, where we will put these techniques into practice and demonstrate how to implement them in PyTorch. Thanks for joining us on this journey through the world of weight quantization.
# Chapter 2: Types of Quantization and Quantization Techniques

Dear readers, welcome back! In the previous chapter, we were introduced to Count Dracula and the different types of quantization and quantization techniques by the famous deep learning pioneer Yann LeCun. Now, in this chapter, we will focus on the implementation of these techniques using PyTorch's quantization tools.

## Implementing Quantization Techniques in PyTorch

Let's start by importing the necessary libraries.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import torchvision
import torchvision.transforms as transforms
```

Now, we will define our deep learning model. Note that we use `nn.quantized.Conv2d` instead of `nn.Conv2d` to perform the convolution using quantized weights.

```python
class Net(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Net, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.quantized.Conv2d(3, 6, 5, bias=False, 
                                          padding=2)
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)
        self.conv2 = nn.quantized.Conv2d(6, 16, 5, bias=False)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(16 * 5 * 5, 120)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(120, 84)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(84, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.pool(nn.functional.relu(self.conv1(x)))
        x = self.pool(nn.functional.relu(self.conv2(x)))
        x = x.view(-1, 16 * 5 * 5)
        x = nn.functional.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = nn.functional.relu(self.fc2(x))
        x = self.fc3(x)
        return x
```

Next, we will define a function that will be used to quantize the model's weights. In this example, we perform uniform quantization using 8 bits.

```python
def quantize_model(model, qconfig):
    model_static_quantized = torch.quantization.quantize_static(
        model, qconfig, run_fn=calibrate, input_calibration=calibration_dataset)
    return model_static_quantized
```

Note that we need to pass a `qconfig` to the `quantize_static` function. This specifies the quantization settings that we want to apply to the model weights. We also need to provide a dataset `calibration_dataset` on which to calibrate the quantization settings.

Now, we will define a function `evaluate` to evaluate the performance of our model.

```python
def evaluate(model, data_loader):
    model.eval()
    correct = 0
    total = 0
    with torch.no_grad():
        for data in data_loader:
            images, labels = data
            outputs = model(images)
            _, predicted = torch.max(outputs.data, 1)
            total += labels.size(0)
            correct += (predicted == labels).sum().item()

    print('Accuracy of the network on the 10000 test images: %d %%' % (
        100 * correct / total))
```

Next, we will define the datasets and data loaders that we will use to train and evaluate our model.

```python
transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize((0.5, 0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5, 0.5))
])

trainset = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10(root='./data', train=True,
                                        download=True, transform=transform)
trainloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(trainset, batch_size=128,
                                          shuffle=True, num_workers=2)

testset = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10(root='./data', train=False,
                                       download=True, transform=transform)
testloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(testset, batch_size=128,
                                         shuffle=False, num_workers=2)
```

Now, we will calibrate our model on the `trainloader` dataset.

```python
def calibrate(model, data_loader, device):
    model.eval()
    with torch.no_grad():
        for batch_idx, (inputs, targets) in enumerate(data_loader):
            inputs = inputs.to(device)
            _ = model(inputs)
```

We're now ready to run our experiments. First, we'll train our model using conventional weights. 

```python
device = torch.device("cuda:0" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
net = Net()
net.to(device)

criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(net.parameters(), lr=0.001, momentum=0.9)

for epoch in range(2):
    running_loss = 0.0
    for i, data in enumerate(trainloader, 0):
        inputs, labels = data
        inputs, labels = inputs.to(device), labels.to(device)
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = net(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

        running_loss += loss.item()
        if i % 2000 == 1999:   
            print('[%d, %5d] loss: %.3f' %
                  (epoch + 1, i + 1, running_loss / 2000))
            running_loss = 0.0
```

We will now evaluate the accuracy of our unquantized model on the `testloader` dataset.

```python
evaluate(net, testloader)
```

Now, we will quantize our model and evaluate its performance.

```python
qconfig = torch.quantization.get_default_qconfig('fbgemm')
calibration_dataset = trainset

net_quantized = quantize_model(net, qconfig)
net_quantized.to(device)

evaluate(net_quantized, testloader)
```

That's it for this chapter. We hope you found it informative and that you are excited to try out quantization techniques on your PyTorch models. Stay tuned for our next chapter on Advanced Quantization Techniques!
