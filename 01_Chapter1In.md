# Chapter 1: Introduction to Quantization of Weights in PyTorch

Welcome to the world of model quantization, where we will explore the fascinating technique of quantizing the weights of our machine learning models. 

In this chapter, we'll cover the basics of model quantization, why it's essential, and how to implement it using PyTorch. From simple linear layers to complex convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we'll guide you through various quantization techniques and provide code samples as we go.

This chapter would not be complete without the insights and advice of Yann LeCun himself. LeCun, a computer scientist, known for his work in deep learning, will weigh in on why quantized weights in models can improve performance and reduce memory consumption.

Quantizing your model's parameters, like weights and biases, can assist in the deployment of the model on diverse platforms such as mobile devices and FPGA. It can increase computational efficiency, storage optimization, and more.

We hope you are ready to learn about this exciting technique that can enhance your model's performance while saving memory and computational power. Let's get started!
# Chapter 1: Introduction to Quantization of Weights in PyTorch

Once upon a time, in the beautiful green forests of Nottingham, Robin Hood and his Merry Men were always strategizing and inventing new ways to outsmart the Sheriff of Nottingham. One day, Robin saw his friend Little John struggling with a heavy bag full of PyTorch models. "What's in there, John?" asked Robin as he helped him with the bag.

Little John sighed, "These are PyTorch models that take up too much memory. We can't use them for the mobile devices we wanted to deploy them on."

Robin knew that this was a problem that had to be solved. Just then, he remembered a technique called quantizing weights in PyTorch that Yann LeCun, one of the pioneers of deep learning, had discussed with him once. So, Robin and his Merry Men decided to dive deeper into the world of PyTorch quantization.

They quickly realized that quantized weights could significantly reduce memory consumption while maintaining performance. They learned that model quantization involves transforming model parameters, such as weights and biases, from high precision with a vast range of possible values to low precision values with reduced ranges.

Yann LeCun himself, who had joined them in their quest, reiterated the significance of quantized weights. "Quantizing the weights of neural networks is essential to run deep learning models efficiently on mobile or embedded devices with limited memory and power," he explained.

With this new knowledge, Robin and his Merry Men got to work. They pulled up their laptops and started the implementation. Robin opened up his PyTorch model and started quantizing the weights. He created a simple linear layer and employed the `qconfig` feature for dynamic quantization.

    import torch
    import torch.nn as nn
    from torch.quantization import QuantStub, DeQuantStub, quantize_dynamic

    # Define a simple linear layer
    class SimpleLinear(nn.Module):
        def __init__(self):
            super(SimpleLinear, self).__init__()
            
            self.qconfig = torch.quantization.get_default_qconfig('fbgemm')
            self.quant = QuantStub()
            self.dequant = DeQuantStub()
            self.linear = nn.Linear(8, 32)
            
        def forward(self, x):
            x = self.quant(x)
            x = self.linear(x)
            x = self.dequant(x)
            
            return x

    # Quantize the model
    model = SimpleLinear()
    model_static_q = quantize_dynamic(model, {torch.nn.Linear}, dtype=torch.qint8)

Robin and his Merry Men were amazed by how simple the process was. They also tried out various other quantization techniques like static quantization and learned that they could even reduce the storage requirements by up to four times that of the floating-point model.

Finally, Robin and his Merry Men looked at the models they had quantized, and they were thrilled to see that not only had they reduced memory consumption but their model's performance remained unchanged.

And so, Robin and his Merry Men had saved the day once again. They had implemented model quantization in PyTorch, thanks to their friend Yann LeCun and his valuable insights. They looked forward to experimenting with more models and further optimizing their performance with quantization.
In the Robin Hood story, we used PyTorch to quantize the weights of a simple linear layer. The code we used to achieve this was straightforward and involved using PyTorch's quantization functions.

First, we imported the necessary PyTorch libraries:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torch.quantization import QuantStub, DeQuantStub, quantize_dynamic
```

Next, we defined the simple linear layer and added the necessary quantization stubs (`QuantStub` and `DeQuantStub`) to the modules for dynamic quantization:

```python
class SimpleLinear(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleLinear, self).__init__()

        self.qconfig = torch.quantization.get_default_qconfig('fbgemm')
        self.quant = QuantStub()
        self.dequant = DeQuantStub()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(8, 32)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.quant(x)
        x = self.linear(x)
        x = self.dequant(x)

        return x
```

In the `__init__` method, we created `QuantStub` and `DeQuantStub` objects, and set the `qconfig` using PyTorch's `get_default_qconfig` function. In the `forward` method, we applied the quantization and dequantization to the input tensor to ensure that the weights were quantized correctly.

Finally, we created the instance of the `SimpleLinear` model and quantized the model using the `quantize_dynamic` function:

```python
model = SimpleLinear()
model_static_q = quantize_dynamic(model, {torch.nn.Linear}, dtype=torch.qint8)
```

We passed the model instance, along with the layers to be quantized (in this case, the `nn.Linear` layer), and the dtype for the quantized weights to the `quantize_dynamic` function.

And that's it! With just a few lines of code, we were able to quantize the weights of our model and reduce the memory requirements while maintaining performance.
