# Chapter 5: Applications and Future Trends in Quantization of Weights in PyTorch

Welcome to the final chapter of our PyTorch quantization journey! If you're reading this chapter, you're already familiar with the basics of quantization of weights, the available techniques, and their performance evaluation. In this chapter, we'll take a look at some of the fascinating applications and future trends in quantization of weights using PyTorch.

But to keep you on your toes, we decided to twist this chapter into a Sherlock Holmes mystery! So put on your sleuthing hats and let's get started.

Sherlock Holmes received an urgent letter from his colleague, Yoshua Bengio. In it, Bengio explained that he had been working on a highly confidential project for the government involving natural language processing. He had been using PyTorch to train and deploy his models. However, the government required the models to be highly compressed for deployment on resource-constrained devices.

After experimenting with various quantization techniques, Bengio discovered a new technique that could compress his models while maintaining high accuracy. However, his PyTorch quantization code had suddenly stopped working. He had tried everything but couldn't get his code to work again. In his letter, Bengio requested Holmes' assistance in solving the mystery.

Holmes arrived at Bengio's lab and examined the PyTorch quantization code. He immediately noticed an issue in the code. Bengio had been using an older version of PyTorch, and the new version had introduced changes to the quantization API.

Holmes quickly updated the code to reflect the changes in the new API. He then ran the code and confirmed that it was working correctly. Bengio was relieved and thanked Holmes for his assistance.

But the mystery didn't end there. Bengio revealed that the government project was highly sensitive, and they required the models to be highly encrypted during deployment. Holmes knew that PyTorch had recently introduced support for encrypted deep learning using homomorphic encryption.

He quickly implemented homomorphic encryption into Bengio's quantization code, ensuring that the models were highly encrypted during deployment.

With the mystery solved and Bengio's project ready for deployment, Holmes and Bengio reflected on the many applications of PyTorch quantization, including compressed models for mobile devices and encrypted models for secure deployments in the cloud. They also discussed the latest trends in quantization, such as the development of new quantization techniques and support for even more complex models.

In conclusion, the world of applications and future trends in quantization of weights in PyTorch is vast and exciting. With the right techniques and tools, we can compress and encrypt our models while maintaining high accuracy. So let's keep exploring and pushing the boundaries of what's possible with PyTorch!
The code used to resolve the Sherlock Holmes mystery was a matter of updating the PyTorch quantization code to reflect changes to the API in the latest version of the library. The following updated code resolved the initial issue:

```python
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.quantization as quant

# Define the model
class MyModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyModel, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 6, 5)
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(6, 16, 5)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(16 * 5 * 5, 120)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(120, 84)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(84, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.pool(self.relu(self.conv1(x)))
        x = self.pool(self.relu(self.conv2(x)))
        x = x.view(-1, 16 * 5 * 5)
        x = self.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.relu(self.fc2(x))
        x = self.fc3(x)
        return x

# Instantiate the model
model = MyModel()

# Add quantization to the model
quantized_model = quant.quantize_dynamic(model, {nn.Linear}, dtype=torch.qint8)

```

As for implementing homomorphic encryption into Bengio's quantization code, it involved the use of the PySyft library, which integrates with PyTorch to provide support for homomorphic encryption. The following code accomplished this:

```python
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.quantization as quant
import syft as sy

# Define the model
class MyModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyModel, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 6, 5)
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(6, 16, 5)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(16 * 5 * 5, 120)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(120, 84)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(84, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.pool(self.relu(self.conv1(x)))
        x = self.pool(self.relu(self.conv2(x)))
        x = x.view(-1, 16 * 5 * 5)
        x = self.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.relu(self.fc2(x))
        x = self.fc3(x)
        return x

# Instantiate the model
model = MyModel()

# Add quantization to the model
quantized_model = quant.quantize_dynamic(model, {nn.Linear}, dtype=torch.qint8)

# Encrypt the quantized model using homomorphic encryption provided by PySyft
hook = sy.TorchHook(torch)
secure_worker = sy.VirtualWorker(hook, id="secure_worker")
encrypted_model = quantized_model.fix_prec().share(secure_worker)
``` 

These two code changes allowed us to successfully resolve the issue and deliver a highly encrypted model for Bengio's government project.
